\section{Future Work}

Each architectural component from the software switch has space for improvements. New algorithms and data structures are objects of study for the Flow Table matching. More complex and precise algorithms for rate limiting might be considered for better Meter Table performance. As for groups, new bucket select types may be a subject for academic research. 

While there are open ideas for further research and development, some optimizations and features are planned for the software switch in the medium-term. These major improvements are listed below:

\chapter{Development}
\label{cap:cap04}

This chapter covers the software switch development. In section \ref{softfeatures}, we give details about the implementation of the most important BNG features.

\section{Software switch implementation}
\label{softfeatures}

In this section we discuss how we implemented the BNG software switch adding several changes to the base switch - using C \footnote{In this chapter there will be two common words: struct and structure. While struct is a P4 language keyword and structure is a more generic word for a collection of data variables, both will be used to denote a C struct.}, the switch native programming language, and C++ - in order to support all features and keep it as simple as possible.

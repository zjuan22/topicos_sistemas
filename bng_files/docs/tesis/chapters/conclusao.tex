...
*In the next two sections, we present some obtained results and notorious use cases. Finally, we conclude this chapter discussing future areas for research and improvement in the software switch.     

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

*In this section we list positive results achieved on the dissemination of our work:  

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Publications.} 
%This work gave origin to three publications. The first paper is about IPv6 support on OpenFlow. The second is an invited paper bringing perspectives on SDN for home network. These ideas were inspired by the software switch port to OpenWRT. Finally, the last paper is an overall presentation of this project, highlighting architectural and implementation details. These publications are listed on Annex \ref{AnnexB}.  
\end{itemize}


\section{Use Cases}
\label{sec:cases}

%Known use cases show that the software is an important tool in the advance of the state of art on SDN research and development. As there is a large number of projects that are using or have made use of our work, we will list some notorious examples: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Base for new Gateway  features implementation.} 

\item \textbf{Academic.} The software switch has found good adoption by the academic community. 

\item \textbf{Industry.} Industrial development is harder to track because it is usually closed. However, one successful case is in the development of an application for ISP or Telco enterprise like Ericsson. 

\end{itemize}
